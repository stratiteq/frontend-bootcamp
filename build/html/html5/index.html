<p>HTML5 introduces a plethora of functionality that is meant to make our lives as developers easier and enable us to create better experiences for the users of our apps. But some of the more basic new functionality concerns layout and semantics. The problem with the old way of writing webapps, using divs for almost anything and settings classes on them is that classes are only semantic to other developers, not to machines. This might seem trivial but it creates real problems for screen readers, and we all know hard it can be to scrape useful data from a website. HTML5 tries to solve this by adding more semantic elements that we have to understand how to use, or else we will be stuck with the old problem but in a new way.</p>
